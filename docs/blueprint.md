# **App Name**: HVAC Design Pro

## Core Features:

- Cooling Load Estimation: Estimate the cooling load based on room geometry, environmental conditions, and room usage parameters using ASHRAE guidelines. The estimation uses AI to reason from incomplete data using historical performance metrics for various building types and climate zones.
- AC Capacity Recommendation: Recommend appropriate AC capacity in Tons of Refrigeration (TR) or kW, suggesting single or multiple units and AC type (Split, Cassette, Ducted, VRF) based on room type and cooling load.
- AC Placement Design: Recommend the optimal indoor AC unit position (wall or ceiling-mounted), suggesting distance from ceiling and walls, and providing reasoning for optimal air circulation, comfort, and efficiency. LLM will function as a tool to guide on the optimal placing given real world constraints.
- Airflow Direction & Distribution: Define recommended airflow direction (horizontal, angled, multi-directional) with consideration of throw length and avoidance of direct draft on occupants, suggesting the best air distribution strategy.
- Energy Efficiency Suggestions: Provide tips to improve energy efficiency, including inverter AC suggestions, insulation improvements, window shading, and thermostat settings.
- User Input Forms: UI components for entering room geometry, environmental conditions, and room usage parameters.
- HVAC Design Summary Display: Display a structured summary of HVAC design recommendations, including room overview, cooling load analysis, recommended AC system, AC placement, airflow design, and efficiency recommendations.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft blue (#78A3E6) to evoke feelings of calmness and reliability, important in a technical context.
- Background color: Very light blue (#F0F4FF), nearly white to ensure maximum legibility.
- Accent color: Light orange (#E6A378), provides warmth and indicates action items.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif with a modern, machined, objective, neutral look.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for any code or technical specifications displayed.
- Use simple, clear icons to represent different HVAC components and parameters.
- Clean and structured layout to present detailed HVAC design information clearly.
